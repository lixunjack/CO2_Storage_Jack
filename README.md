ECO-AI Project: Carbon Capture and Storage with AI

Logging my code development for a three-day Hackathon (https://ai4netzero.github.io/eco-ai/hackathon/)

About the Hackathon:

The ECO-AI Hackathon, hosted at ai4netzero.github.io/eco-ai/hackathon/, is a collaborative event aimed at fostering innovation and collaboration among PhD students and Postdoctoral Research Associates (PDRAs). Over the course of three days, participants are challenged to address unique problems related to CCS, including its economics and policy implications.

I and other four team members were having access to tools, support, and data necessary to develop new code and explore current challenges in:

    Subsurface flow modeling using AI
